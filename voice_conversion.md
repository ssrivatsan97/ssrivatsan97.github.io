***Abstract*** — The Voice Conversion task involves converting speech from one speaker’s (source) voice to another speaker’s (target) voice. Machine learning methods can be made to perform better than plain signal processing techniques as they can take into account multiple features of speech which cannot be characterized easily by signal processing techniques. In this project, we have explored the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for Voice Conversion. We have explored multiple variations of RNNs using LSTMs and GRUs and observed the effects of changing various parameters of the models. Our approach uses two independently trained neural networks - one which converts source speech to phonemes and another which converts phonemes to target speech. We will present the results achieved by both the networks for these different parameters.

### **Education** ###
1. B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering (2015 - 2019)<br/>
Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (Mumbai, India)
2. PhD in Electrical Engineering (2019 - present)<br/>
Stanford University (California, USA)

My current research is on the security and performance of blockchain protocols. I am also broadly interested in information theory, machine learning, and their intersections.

I am currently working as a senior researcher at [BabylonChain](https://babylonlabs.io/).
I was advised by [Prof. David Tse](https://tselab.stanford.edu/) during my PhD. I have also done internships with [Mysten Labs](https://mystenlabs.com/), [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/), and [Subspace Labs](https://subspace.network/).

Please look at my [projects](/projects) to know about my research and publications.

I am also a violinist and singer in the Carnatic (south Indian) classical style of music. I am an ardent fan of Indian classical music and I'm committed to preserving and popularising this art. <br/>

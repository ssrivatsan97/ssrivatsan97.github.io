My current research is in analyzing and imporving the security and latency of blockchain protocols. I am also broadly interested in information theory, machine learning, and their intersections. I am grateful to have [Prof. David Tse]( https://tselab.stanford.edu/) and [Prof. Mert Pilanci](https://stanford.edu/~pilanci/) as my PhD advisors.

Please read my [CV](CV.pdf) or look at my [projects](/projects) to know about my work and achievements.


I am also a violinist and singer in the Carnatic (south Indian) classical style of music. I am an ardent fan of Indian classical music and I'm committed to preserving and popularising this art. <br/>

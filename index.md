I am an undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (Mumbai, India), pursuing my B.Tech. degree in Electrical Engineering.

My research interests broadly include signal processing (theory, and music/speech/image applications), machine learning, information theory and circuits.

I am also a singer and a violinist with training in the Carnatic (south Indian) classical style of music. I am very passionate about music and this has also led to my research interest in music information retrieval.

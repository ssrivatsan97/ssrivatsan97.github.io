## **Other Projects** ##
#### 2018 ####
1. **Secure Multiparty Computation**<br/>
*Project guided by [Prof. Sibiraj Pillai](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~bsraj/), [Prof. Vinod Prabhakaran](http://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~vinodmp/), [Prof. Manoj Prabhakaran](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~mp/) (as B.Tech. project)*<br/>
In this problem, two parties Alice (A) and Bob (B) have private data X and Y, respectively. A third party Charlie (C) needs to compute a function Z = f(X,Y). This must be done in such a way that each party does not learn anything more about other parties' private data than what they already know. We wish to prove lower bounds on the amount of randomness and communication required to achieve this.<br/>

1. **See in the Dark**<br/>
*Image Processing project along with R. Shrinivas*<br/>
See in the dark is a method to reconstruct bright images from dark (low light, low exposure) images. The goal is to have such a reconstruction without increasing the noise in the resulting image. We have presented an end-to-end system for this purpose using a cGAN (Conditional Generative Adversarial Network). This project was partly inspired by [Learning to See in the Dark](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01934) (Chen et. al.)<br/>

1. **RF Fingerprinting Based Authentication for Bluetooth Low Energy**<br/>
*Internship project in Massachusetts Institute of Technology*<br/>
This project is an attempt to authenticate Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transmitters by identifying them through features extracted from their transmitted signals. This classification of transmitters based on features from their signals is RF Fingerprinting. The objective for such authentication in this project is to prevent battery drainage attacks on ultra-low power bluetooth receivers for IoT networks. My contribution was in developing a feature extraction pipeline and neural network for RF Fingerprinting, and reducing the energy consumption of this system.<br/>

1. **Voice Conversion**<br/>
*Machine Learning project along with Nihal Singh, Arpan Banerjee*<br/>
The Voice Conversion task involves converting speech from one speaker’s (source) voice to another speaker’s (target) voice. Machine learning methods can be made to perform better than plain signal processing techniques as they can take into account multiple features of speech which cannot be characterized easily by signal processing techniques. In this 
project, we have explored the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for Voice Conversion. We have explored multiple variations of RNNs using LSTMs and GRUs and observed the effects of changing various parameters of the models. Our approach uses two independently trained neural networks - one which converts source speech to phonemes and another which converts phonemes to target speech. We will present the results achieved by both the networks for these different parameters.<br/>

1. **Digitally Programmable Analog Computer**<br/>
*Electronics Design project with Dhruv Shah, Sachin Goyal*<br/>
The goal of this project was to design an analog computer that can simulate linear dynamical systems for real-time simulations. We designed the analog computer to solve systems modeled by upto 5th order coupled linear differential equations. It was made digitally programmable by using an on-board microcontroller which can be programmed via a serial interface. The entire circuit was pabricated on a PCB with on-board power management, and was tested extensively to accurately simulate the given systems in real time. This project was supported by the Prof. Mukul Chandorkar, dept. of Electrical Engg. IIT Bombay for hardware-in-loop simulations in the power electronics lab.<br/>
